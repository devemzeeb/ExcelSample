**Sample of Excel data cleaning, filtering, sorting and merging**

Here you can see three Excel files containing housing information of a city. There are data on housing units between the years 2005 and 2009. It is to be mentioned that, these were txt files and I imported them in Excel. Then, I merged the Value of the files from 2007 and 2009 with the file 2005. I then cleaned the data. I filtered the Value2005, Value2007 and Value2009 columns. I looked for all the values less than 1000 dollars and deleted them. I did the same for all three columns.
